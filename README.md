# Basic-Time-Records :watch: 

The application allows you to record working time. Thanks to a simple stopwatch, you can adjust the working time. The comments section allows you to add and edit comment text (textarea). What's more, after the work is finished, you can export the table to the excel file by clicking the "Export file to excel" button.
